# BattleshipGame
This is a rudimentary version of the famous Battleship game written in C# (ASP.Net), JavaScript, and CSS.

# Set up instructions
Open in Visual Studio and hit F5 or drop the contents into a published folder on a Windows Server.  Make sure you have .Net Framework v4.8.1 installed.

# My Process
I spent about 30 minutes first deciding if it would be overkill to create classes for the board and the ships.  In the end I did both.  While I think the Board class was a good idea, the Ship class was probably overkill.  After some more drawing class diagrams and getting my head around how I wanted to approach it, I spent a couple of hours coding.  Once I realized I was writing code that would be served by the UI, I decided to create the page design.  I find that once you have a design and the supporting classes created, things really move along quickly.  So it didn't take much longer before I was debugging and trying not to be affected by scope creep.  I had a couple of friends play the game and ... viola!
